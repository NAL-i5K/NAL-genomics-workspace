Dear {{first_name}},

Just a reminder that some users are volunteering to help annotate the {{species}} genome and waiting for the response. You can grant them access to Web Apollo through the management page in https://{{website}}.

Please email us (i5k@ars.usda.gov) if you are experiencing any difficulties with this function.

Thanks!

The NAL i5k team
