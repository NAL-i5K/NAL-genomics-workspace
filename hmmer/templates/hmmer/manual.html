<h2>HMMER: biosequence analysis using profile hidden Markov models</h2>
<p>Reference: <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">http://hmmer.janelia.org/</a></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein sequences, and for making protein sequence alignments. It implements methods using probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs).<p>
<p>HMMER can be used to search sequence databases with single query sequences (phmmer) and an alignment of multiple instances of a sequence family (hmmsearch). It provides significantly accurate and more able to detect remote homologs because of the strength of its underlying mathematical models.<p>

<h3>i5K-HMMER Tutorial</h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we explain some of the features of the HMMER site.<p>
<p>To begin, navigate to the HMMER site via the bar, or go directly to <a href="http://i5k.nal.usda.gov/hmmer/">http://i5k.nal.usda.gov/hmmer/</a> <p>
<p>Under the 'Organism menu', select one or several organisms that you would like to search against. Then, select which database should be searched. Unlike BLAST, available databases only include protein sequences predicted from the genome.<p>

<p><br>

<p>Paste your query sequence into the 'Query Sequence' field, or load it from disk. <p>
<p>Program phmmer only accepts fasta file as query input, so it's not avaiable when input file is not fasta. However, program hmmsearch accept several different formats of multiple sequence alignment(also include fasta), format will be checked after submitting job.<p>
<p>Fasta as the input file.  Phmmer and Hmmsearch are both avaiable.<p>

<p>When CLUSTAL MSA format as input type and phmmer is greyed out.<p>

<p><br>
<p><br>

<p>Once the correct HMMER program is selected, choosing parameters which are suitable for individual condition. Hit the 'Search' button when finished.<p>

<p><br>
<p><br>

<p>A page will display indicating that your query is running. You can store the indicated query link if you wish to come back to your HMMER results at a later time. Results are stored for one week.<p>

<p><br>
<p><br>

<p>When the HMMER program has finished, your results will be displayed.<p>
<p>In 'Download' could download input file, HMMER result (showed in 'Details Report') and submission details including parameters used in this job. <p>
<p>In 'Details Reports', reports are separated into independent sections by protein datasets. Use the drop-down list to navigate among them.i<p>
